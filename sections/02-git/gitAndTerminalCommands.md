## ‚õô Understanding Merge Conflicts

### What Are Merge Conflicts?

Merge conflicts occur when Git cannot automatically merge changes because the same parts of a file have been modified in different ways on different branches. This commonly happens when:

- Two people edit the same line of code
- One person edits a file while another person deletes it
- Two people add different content to the same location in a file

---

### How Merge Conflicts Happen

1. **Same File, Different Changes**: Two branches modify the same lines of code
2. **Divergent History**: Branches have evolved independently with overlapping changes
3. **Conflicting Operations**: One branch adds content while another deletes the same area

---

### Common Scenarios

| Scenario                        | Description                                | Example                                                  |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Line-level conflicts**        | Same lines modified differently            | Both branches change the same function name              |
| **File deletion conflicts**     | One branch deletes, other modifies         | Branch A deletes `config.js`, Branch B updates it        |
| **Content insertion conflicts** | Both branches add content at same location | Both branches add different imports at the top of a file |

---

### How to Resolve Merge Conflicts

#### Step 1: Identify Conflicts

When Git encounters a merge conflict, it marks the conflicting sections in your files using conflict markers like this:

```plaintext
<<<<<<< HEAD
Your changes on the current branch
Example: <h1>Hello World</h1>
=======
Incoming changes from the branch you're merging
Example: <h1 style="color:blue">Hello World!!!</h1>
>>>>>>> feature-branch
```

These markers help you see exactly what parts are in conflict between the two versions of the file.

#### Step 2: Manually Edit the File

Go through each marked conflict and decide which changes to keep. You have three options:

- Keep your version
- Keep the incoming version
- Combine both manually

After editing, remove the conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>) from the file.

#### Step 3: Mark as Resolved

Once you've finished resolving all conflicts in a file: <br>
`git add <filename>`<br>
Repeat this for every conflicted file.

#### Step 4: Complete the Merge

Once all conflicts are resolved and added:<br>
`git commit`<br>
Git may auto-generate a commit message for the merge. You can edit it or leave it as is.
